    The Brotherhood is a fictional, exclusive and secretive organization that controls the sea, guards the coast and maintains the trade routes.
    Its ancient purpose has been lost to history, but it is related to the sea.
    It's composed of highly skilled and experienced individuals who are sworn to protect the realm from sea-borne threats.
    The Brotherhood is maintained by the constant contributions from the nations of the realm.
    Members are locked in with the organization for a certain period or lifetime, they cannot marry, hold property, have children, or have contact with their families.
    They can only be punished by their order for their crimes, and they cannot go back home.
    Punishment for desertion or escape can include flogging and hard labor, or even execution.
    They take vows of loyalty and service and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their cause.
    They have a strict code of conduct and a sacred rituals.
    Members of the Brotherhood do not survive to old ages due to high-risk missions, rigorous training and conditioning, the secretive and dangerous ancient purpose, illnesses or disease, old age, or natural disasters.
    The Brotherhood has a ritual that alters the body of its members, allowing them to hold their breath for long hours in water, see better in the dark, move swiftly in water and heal faster.
    The ritual has a price: a reduced lifespan at random, social exclusion, and risk of exposure.
    The Brotherhood also has Kelpies as pets and companions, they use them for transportation and reconnaissance.
    The Brotherhood has the duty of protecting and preserving the Kelpies as a species, and in return, the Kelpies aid the Brotherhood in their transportation and reconnaissance purposes.

	The Brotherhood was created to protect the realm from a natural and cyclic threat, which changes the ocean and the marine life, making them aggressive towards the land dwellers. The Brotherhood has knowledge of the threat and has developed a ritual based on it to protect themselves and the realm from it. 

	Brotherhood, which is a fictional organization that guards the coast, controls the sea and with a purpose to protect the world from a cyclic threat that emerges from the ocean every few thousands of years. The threat is a portal that opens in the ocean and allows creatures or monsters to come through. The Brotherhood was created by an ancient civilization that was destroyed by this threat and they had to take drastic measures to submerge more than half the world in water in order to close the portal and stop the creatures.

The Brotherhood is composed of men only, who join the organization through conscription, volunteering or as a sentence/punishment.

	The Brotherhood's ancient purpose was something related to sea, but most have forgotten or their true purpose has turned into legends and fairy tales. They stay neutral and don't include themselves in any kind of political and war between nations or kingdoms. They are not moved by money. Their cause is bigger than that. 

	Their Hierarichal structure is:

	Grand Admiral: The highest-ranking member of the Brotherhood, responsible for leading the entire organization and making strategic decisions.

	Admiral: Responsible for leading a fleet of ships and brothers, and carrying out the orders of the Grand Admiral.

	Commander: Responsible for leading a group of ships within a fleet, and carrying out the orders of the Admiral.

	Captain: Responsible for commanding a single ship and its crew, and carrying out the orders of the Commander.

	Lieutenant: Responsible for specific tasks such as navigation, gunnery, and signal communication, and carrying out the orders of the Captain.

	Brother-Sergeant: Responsible for leading a group of brothers within a ship and for discipline, training and execution of orders.

	Brother-Corporal: Responsible for assisting the brother-sergeants in their duties and leading a group of brothers within a ship.

	Seaman: Responsible for carrying out the orders of the officers and for the day to day operations of the ship.

	Boys: Young recruits who are in training to become full members of the brotherhood.

Their Oath is: 

	I am a sentinel of the sea,
Guarding against what's yet to be.
With my brothers, I'll face the tide,
And against all odds, we'll stand with pride.

Sacrifice is our solemn vow,
For the greater god, we'll give our all.
War is not our wish to seek,
But I always ready to see it meet.

My life may be short, but it will be true,
For I'll have served in a brotherhood that sees it through.
With every breath, I'll keep the sea's peace,
With our lives we'll keep the tempests cease.







However, as the creator of the concept, you may want to consider some points to refine the concept and avoid any loopholes or plotholes :

    The Brotherhood being created to protect the realm from a cyclic threat that emerges from the ocean every few thousands of years, that's a huge responsibility, it would be interesting to know more about the threat, how the Brotherhood knows about it, how they developed the ritual, and how they ensure to keep the threat at bay.
    
	The Brotherhood's neutral stance, not including themselves in any kind of political and war between nations or kingdoms, and not being moved by money, is a bit unrealistic, as any organization would have to interact with other entities.
   
	 The Brotherhood's ritual that alters the body of its members, allowing them to hold their breath for long hours in water, see better in the dark, move swiftly in water, and heal faster, could be more detailed and explained. How is the ritual done, who performs it, and how does it work?
   
	 The Brotherhood's duty of protecting and preserving the Kelpies as a species, in return, the Kelpies aid the Brotherhood in their transportation and reconnaissance purposes, could be more detailed and explained. How are the Kelpies related to the Brotherhood, and how do they aid them?
