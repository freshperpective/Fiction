The first step to improving the story would be to identify the main plot and main characters. The main plot of the story appears to be Jia and Nate's quest to discover the truth about their past, including what happened beneath the keep in Penketh and the reasons behind Shanya's betrayal. Jia, Nate, and Shanya are the main characters in the story.

Once the main plot and main characters are established, the next step would be to build the subplots and other characters around them. The subplots could include Nate's struggles at the academy and his conscription into the Brotherhood of the Seas, Jia's journey to find Natalia and learn about her powers, and Natalia's own motivations and actions.

It's also important to develop the world-building, including the society and culture of the characters, the Grey skins and the reason of why they are treated differently. This will help the audience understand the context of the story and the motivations of the characters.

Finally, it's important to ensure that the motivations and actions of the characters are clear, consistent, and make sense within the context of the story. This will make them more relatable and interesting to the audience.

A species of tree called the keep Oaks are present within the world which links the Ishyats/Grey skins to link the spiritual realm where their ancestors are. It is also their link to the after life when their bodies are buried near the roots or the tree itself. It's fruits give them a prolonged life and the sap is used to heal. The trees and its wood is very resistant to fire but if burned it last hours. One small log burns for the entire night. There is a forest of them of varying size and shapes called the forest that remembers or Remembering forest. It is the place where many grey skin go to bury their dead ones. 

Ishyats/Grey Skins :- They have grey lead like skin with White hair. They have yellow eyes and thought the shapes and body type are varying like humans. Mostly they are skin and short compared to human. Average height of Grey skins is five feet with the tallest being 5'5''. Though hybrids are a different story.

Hybrids :- People who were born from parents where one was human and the other was Grey skin. Hybrids are limited by the restrictions of either races. Their hieghts can reach that of humans. They can either looke like grey skins or like humans or can have partial traits from both of them.

Jia and her nephew Nate have shifted from their old town Penketh to new one Hebe. Their old town was decimated by a sudden attack that killed Nate's father. The attack wouldn't have happened if not for the betrayal by Nate's sister Shanya. Who disappeared after the attack and also stole the blade Jia has been making for a week. The main purpose of the attack done by a terrorist organization was to destroy the purple corrupted  beneath the keep of Penketh. And they were successful thanks to Shanya's help. In that same destruction Jia gained or awakened her powers of seeing the past of things. She can't control it yet. She hasn't tried to. For the most part, it has only shown her painful and brutal memories linked to objects and places. Nate has been enrolled in the academy at Hebe for 3 years now and next week is the advanced selection where he will choose depending on his grades the specialized field to further study and progress in. I want to know what was beneath the keep? I know the reason why Shanya betrayed both her aunt and her brother. She found out that they all are not blood-related. See Jia, her sister Nia(Who is dead now), and Shanya are artificially created beings by experiments on Grey skins and humans. Grey skins are a race of people who can telepathically talk with each other and have to use words with humans. Most are not great at their tongue so they also use sign language sometimes. Shanya found out that Nia and Jia are not even sisters and her mother Nia is not her real mother. Jia and Nia are also hybrids created artificially like her. The Greywoods, A small smithing family in Penketh just adopted and raised them as their own. Nia even married Ethaniel Greywood(father of Nate) the son of Visral Greywood. Jia and Nate don't know why Shanya has betrayed them. She didn't explain it before running away. Shanya thinks that Nate too is artificial like her. So now Jia has to know how and why she got these powers. Control them or ignore them. Take care of Nate as his only family in the world is now Jia and Shanya. And also find Shanya and bring her back home. 


The scenes/plotpoints so far I have in mind are:

-Nate after getting selected in the Advancement exam will study for a year or two more while also trying to find out the where abouts of Shanya along with Jia. They find out something from someone or somewhere but before they could act upon it Nate makes a mistake and cripples a ruling family boy. He is then punished by executiona along with three of his friends.

-Two of his friends are executed next day and Nate and his mute friend wait for their execution on the upcoming morning. But then their cell door opens and Jia along with another man stand their. The man is from the brotherhood of the seas and he conscripts Nate and the mute as boys in his order and saves them although at the cost of upsetting the royalty.

-Jia had to pay a price for convincing the officer of the Brotherhood for conscription by agreeing to the deal that she will go with one of the mentors who wants to stuy her powers. She knows what can happen to her where she is going but their was no other way to save Nate so she agreed.

-Jia and Nate part ways but not before getting a bit more information about Shanya who is now known as Natalia. Since Nate can't follow up on the lead because of his conscription Jia does. She goes to the town where Natalia is and she founds her. But not before mistakingly exposingher identity. A battle insues and the whole town is again engulfed in war. The lords of the town loses his wife and child in the scuffle. Jia along with another chases an injured Natalia to the roof of a building. They corner her. But before she could be slain by the man Jia kills him to protect Natalia. Natalia explain why she is doing all this to her. She knows that both of her existence are a lie. That they are beings who shouldn't exist and she will make sure that the nation who creates these kinds of monstrosities is dead forever. And then she jumps of the building.










Jia is a smithy Penketh. SHe has been working a special sword for a week. The order was from the Lord of Penketh, The Second eldest Ravenwood, Hendrik. On the day of the attack her nephew was at the school and her brother-in-law was at the citadel military camp with other Rays. The attack started with a fireball that landed near the walls. Then it was like clouds have changed from using water to fire as the sky filled with sparkling light which rained down on the town. Jia in a panic dashed to the citadel where the school was also located. She was looking for her family. Her nephew Nathaniel(Nathan), her brother in law - Ethaniel, her niece - Shanya. Then she saw him, Ethaniel Greywood, father to both Nathan and Shanya. He was heading to the basement/dungeon beneath the keep. Jia followed though slowly. As she went in she saw something which were only rumors till that point. She knew Penketh beside being  aport was also called the surgeon town. But she didn't knew there was another hospital beneath the castle. Beds were laid on which tired, shruken and weak people lay. Some of them were even bleeding. Their blood black in color. Most of them were odd creatures. They looked like human but all of them had dark mist skin. White hairs even though they were young. And bright yellow eyes that lit up in the lamp lights. Grey skins? Jia thought. Why here though? Why not the hospitals in the city? The woman she passed by groaned from the blood letting. Her babe lay beside her. Unmoving. Their was another, a man with wrinkly skin. Thin as  a stick. He looked at Jia as she tried to find where Ethaniel went. Then their was a boy who tugged at her garb. 'You have wrong blood. Like me' He said without a smile. she pushed him away and went further in. the narrow path echoed with clashes of metals and screams of men. She lunged and as she came closer a purple glow illuminated the walls around the corner. She stopped at the corner and peaked. And her eyes went wide. Ethaniel lay neath some armor clad men who were washing their blades. One of them climbed over his dead body and moved to the thing that glowed purple. At the center of the room A tree stood. It bark black. It's leaves purple. And it's red fruits lying on the wet red floor squashed beneath the feets. Dozen more men lay aside Ethaniel. Half were from city guards. The rest were rays. The best warriors in the country. Now bleeding. Then the group burned the tree and as it burned one of the men behind Jia caught him and threw him below the large one. The one who probably killed Ehtaniel. As he lift his long blade to do the same to Jia. One of their own stopped the strike. She was just came here. 'We had a deal'. She said beneath the mask. the man retreated the attack. Jia recognized the voice. 'Shany!?' The woman unmasked herself. 'You'll not understand yet. But I hope someday you will' 'No Danu ever did' one of the men from the back said. 'If not then she dies too.' Shany placed her mask back and left with them. The entire roof soon filled with smoke and embers from the burning tree. And as she clutched the still body of Ethaniel crying she passed out in that same smoke and ember. Days later she woke up in the hospital in the city. Her nephew beside her bed. One of the royalty accross them. Nathan was badly injured. His hand was severly burned. They say he tried to lift a burning log to save someone beneath it. 'That lad is brave and foolish like his father' said the royalty. The mans one leg was gone. It was wrapped in bandages. Jia only now noticed their her head also had bandages on it. She touched to feel the roughness of them. But let go soon when it started to hurt. 'Wants to be like his father. One of the rays. North one if I know him.' 'I;m sorry for your loss.' 'You too' Jia said looking at his leg. 'I'm a royalty. I'll find a prosthetic. But I'll first take both of the legs of the ones who did this to me.'

'Same. I want to find them too' Though for a different reason. Jia thought. 


After this major things happen but tell me the worldbuilding so far?


After this Jia forges another sword from the one Ethaniel was fighting with. It was broken in the fight and since it is a family inheritance which should go to Nathan she forges a new one by mixing some color that gives it a blue hue. She keeps it for now but promises that it belongs to nathan and she will give it to him when he is ready. When forging though a memeory triggers. One where she is fighting. One where she is on the battle field. The sword unbroken, the way it was before in her hand. her heart heavy. She's bene fighting for hours. Cutting down grey skins after grey skins. But they don't stop coming. And then they sound the retreat. And she follows.  Then Time passes and Nathan gradyuates school and gets admission in the academy at hebe. The place where his father studied. Where Shanya studied. So Jia and Nathan go to Hebe and leave their home in Penketh to the lords. Jia told
