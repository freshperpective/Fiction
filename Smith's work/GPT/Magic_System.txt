I am trying to create a magic system based on Telekinesis. Or sort of partial sentient telekinesis on objects. In this magic system a special amber stone is needed. It comes from mines. But on its own it does nothing. It needs a power source. That power source is a special kind of tree. I haven't decided what part of the tree is used. Maybe its leaves, its flowers, its fruits or even the woods themselves. All I know is that the wood, stem and roots of the tree have concentrated amount of power that they suck from the soil. So humans have cut those trees and are now trying to figure out a way to revive its endangered population by experimentation and hybridization.  But so far very little success. So they have opted for a new way to acquire it. To attack and colonize the lands that have an abundant amount of these trees. These lands have a large forest full of trees among them. And for some reason their these trees seem to grow more easily then they do in the human controlled region. The people living there - Grey Skins are more intrinsically connected to the tree than the humans. For them the forest is sacred. A place where they lay their dead among its roots. They do not harm the tree for they believe that their ancestors live in it. And that it is the only way to connect to them. The only way to go to the after life. So when the humans came they fought to protect these trees. But humans eventually subdued them. They persuaded their rulers. Gave them wealth. Created divides. Forced them in debt and where they couldn't use dialogue they used their telekinesis. The magic works by imbuing the amber stone in the potion or mix made of the special tree.  As long as it last the humans can control the non living object the amber is attached to. It can be an arrow, a knife, a log, a vehicle, a ship. The only catch is that the larger the object the larger the amount required to cover all the points. For example to move a ship, the Amber stone needs to be place and attached in several integral places of the ship. And the sap or the power source from the tree has to be ingested by a human who has bonded with the object or amber stones. I haven't decided the bonding process yet. All I know is that when that object or Amber stones are passed down to another, it has to form the bond again. Forunately the bond making doesn't take long. A person can form a bond to the stones pretty quickly, in a manner of minutes. I just don't know how or what they have to do to make it. I just know thatonce formed the stones move as the bonded wants it to. Sometimes it never happens. The easiest way to make it is to kill the bonded person within the vicinity of the bonded amber. The ones who have the same blood or being of the same blood as the previous owner icreases their chances for forming a bond. But it is not necessary. So a weapon or an object can pass hands even if the new owners are not the descendents of the previous ones. The only condition is that the owner has either died or has abandoned the object for a long time like months or in some cases even years for the bonding to wear off. Due to the nature of this bonding process and it's rules I think that the amber stones are not what they seem at first. Their is some kind of emotional sentience behind them. One that is evoked or connnected to by emotions or a bond. They can but not necessarily connect to something higher or bigger.  


 Another point is the larger the object the closer the operator/owner has to be. That's why arrows can be directed from far away. Spears a little less than the arrows. And Vehicles even lesser. And ships even lesser. Once the ingested amount of powersource from the tree is exhausted in the owner/bonded's through breathing and excessive activity the owner loses its ability of Telekinesis. And the object becomes a normal one and stops moving as the owner wants. That means that while moving a carriage or a ship the driver/Captian has to make sure that they have enough amount to complete their journey. As the amber stone is abundant but the powersource to power them is expensive and rare. Their has become an industry for the two. One that mines and polishes the amber stone for transportation and warfare and the other for the powersource manufacturing. The powersource can be ingested in powder or liquid form. It takes time and effort to refine it from the tree it is obtained from to the means in which it can be consumed. Along the way it produces other side products. One of them is used by humans in medical fields for numbing the pain and dulling the senses. Some junkies use it to get high as well. That's why the source itself is expensive becuase of the processing and the fact that their are so less of the special tress remaining. 

The powersource ingestion and controlling the object takes training and effort. Concentration and many more thing. It can be dangerous and delirious for a newbie to ingest a lot of amount without having any kind of habit or body for it. Academies have opened up that focus to teach just that. Branches of soldiers, sailors, archaelogist, and traders that are taught how to use, manfacter, sell and even find these precious resources.

Our protagonist are two people. Jia, A weaponsmith. One of the few ones in the world who can line the amber stone with the metal and fold it to make a sword. This method is special as it is extremely difficult to work in. The benfit is that the blades or objects made this way have a stronger bond with their owner. So much so that even if a theft did occur and the object is small it can be called back to its bonded owner. The bond also last throughout their family as this kind of weapon can be passed down to descendents which have an easier time bonding with them. These weapons have very difficult time bonding with a person who is not their owner or its descendent. That's why it is very important that the first person who bond with these weapons or objects are the intended ones. The downside is though that the bond making takes a long time. Sometimes it can take weeks, soemtimes months and in extreme cases even years. As the weapon or the object doesn't forget its previous owner even if they havent been used by them or been with them for a long time. The only exception to this is if the owner dies along with their family in the vicinity of the weapon. In that cases the weapon bond resets and a new owner or a family can make a bond with it. Though that too takes time.

My second protagonist is Nathan, nephew of Jia who is attending the academy mentioned before. He makes a bond with a new weapon whose owner had died and is trying to figure out its kinks and his new telekinesis with the sword.




    1. The magic system is based on telekinesis and requires an amber stone and a power source from a special kind of tree.
    2. The amber stone must be imbued with the power source, which can be a sap, leaves, flowers, fruits, or wood from the tree, to function.
    3. The power source can be ingested by a human to control non-living objects attached to the amber stone.
    4. A bond between the human and the amber stone is required for the magic to work and can be formed quickly, but may also be lost over time or if the bonded person dies.
    5. The bond can be formed with a person who has the same blood as the previous owner or by killing the previous owner.
    6. The larger the object being controlled, the more amber stone and power source is needed and the closer the operator must be.
    7. The operator loses the ability to use telekinesis once the ingested power source is exhausted.
    8. The power source is expensive and rare, and there is an industry for both the amber stone and the power source.
    9. The power source can be ingested in powder or liquid form, but its refinement produces other side products, some of which are used for medical or recreational purposes.
    10. Ingesting too much power source without training can be dangerous and delirious.
    11. Academies have opened up to teach people how to use, manufacture, sell, and find the resources.
    12. The protagonist is a weaponsmith named Jia, who is one of the few people in the world who can make a sword using the difficult method of lining the amber stone with metal.
