Based on the information you have provided so far, here is what I have inferred or discerned about the world, story, characters, and magic in your story:

    The story takes place in a world called the Realm, which is made up of at least two countries or cultures: Camilia and Denom. Camilia is a former oppressor of Denom, which was able to gain its independence through a rebellion approximately 40 years before the events of the story.
    The people of Denom have white hair and grey skin, and are known for their rich soil and abundance of a blue stone called Amrita. Denomians rely on Amrita for survival and use it as a source of energy, which recharges in sunlight.
    The culture of Denom is based on Indian culture, while the culture of Camilia is based on Irish, Scottish, and Viking culture. The technology level of the world is pre-Victorian, with guns and other Victorian-era technologies emerging alongside more traditional weapons like swords and cutlasses.
    Slavery is still practiced in Camilia, with most slaves being Denomians or Trians, another race from across the White Mountains to the north of both countries.
    The main character of the story is Shany, a woman from Camilia who has chosen to follow a new faith that is "forsaken" by Camilians and may be seen as taboo or controversial. Shany has a complicated relationship with her sister Jia and a difficult past.
    The mythology of Denom includes three gods: Mother for creation, Father for raising the created, and Stranger for destruction. Mother is benevolent, Father switches between being benevolent and malevolent, and Stranger is malevolent all the time. Each god has their own plane, with Mother's being the highest, followed by Father's and then Stranger's below the earth.
