Based on the information you have provided so far, here is what I have inferred or discerned about the world, story, characters, and magic in your story:

    The story takes place in a world called the Realm, which is made up of at least two countries or cultures: Camilia and Denom. Camilia is a former oppressor of Denom, which was able to gain its independence through a rebellion approximately 40 years before the events of the story.
    The people of Denom have white hair and grey skin, and are known for their rich soil and abundance of a blue stone called Amrita. Denomians rely on Amrita for survival and use it as a source of energy, which recharges in sunlight.
    The culture of Denom is based on Indian culture, while the culture of Camilia is based on Irish, Scottish, and Viking culture. The technology level of the world is pre-Victorian, with guns and other Victorian-era technologies emerging alongside more traditional weapons like swords and cutlasses.
    Slavery is still practiced in Camilia, with most slaves being Denomians or Trians, another race from across the White Mountains to the north of both countries.
    The main character of the story is Shany, a woman from Camilia who has chosen to follow a new faith that is "forsaken" by Camilians and may be seen as taboo or controversial. Shany has a complicated relationship with her sister Jia and a difficult past.
    The mythology of Denom includes three gods: Mother for creation, Father for raising the created, and Stranger for destruction. Mother is benevolent, Father switches between being benevolent and malevolent, and Stranger is malevolent all the time. Each god has their own plane, with Mother's being the highest, followed by Father's and then Stranger's below the earth.

Mind you Brotherhood itself is not all pious and righteous. Sometimes they look out for their own benefit rather than the realm's and they are known to be stubborn. For the most part they don't cross path with the ruling and royal families as they too know that their existence and funding depends on the nations of the world. Also because they don't involve themselves on the politics and wars of the land. But on the very rare occasions when it does happen, More often than not  the ruling family agrees to whatever terms Brotherhood presents them.


it seems that the world in which the Brotherhood exists is one where the nations of the realm rely heavily on the ocean for trade and resources, and thus, the Brotherhood serves as a protectors of the realm's interests in the ocean. The Brotherhood's neutrality in land-based politics and wars suggests that the nations of the realm have their own political and military structures to handle those matters. The Brotherhood's purpose of protecting the realm from threats from the ocean also implies that there is a history of such threats, whether it be from natural disasters, sea monsters, or other dangers. The fact that the Brotherhood is able to maintain its existence and funding through contributions from the nations of the realm suggests that the nations recognize the importance of the Brotherhood's role in protecting their interests in the ocean. Additionally, the fact that the Brotherhood is able to make demands of ruling and royal families on the rare occasions when they do cross paths implies that the Brotherhood holds significant power and influence.

There are more than 4 kingdoms on the main land and several others on other islands, archipelago and other lands. But the major story beats happen on the main land involving those 4 kingdoms and the Brotherhood. That makes five factions. And there is another few factions one of which acts in an anarchic way. Kind of like a terrorists organization. Attacking and disrupting the main land countries. They haven't created any problems for the brotherhood, yet. Then their is another faction of pirates and raider which come from different lands and islands. Most of them are just bandits with ships. The others however have lost their lands and islands due to rising sea level in the last two decades and are looking to settle on a new land which is threatened by the rising seas aka the mainland coasts and high islands. The brotherhoods main problem in this age are this people.

It seems that the world you've created is one that is facing the consequences of climate change, with rising sea levels causing displacement and instability among some of its inhabitants. The Brotherhood, as an organization that is tasked with protecting the realm from the sea, is likely to be at the front lines of this conflict, both in terms of dealing with the influx of refugees and in defending against the pirate and raider factions who are seeking to take advantage of the situation. Additionally, the Brotherhood's focus on the sea and its rituals may have something to do with the fact that it is a male-only organization, possibly because the rituals are only safe for men or only men are capable of undergoing them. The existence of an anarchist faction and a terrorist organization suggests that there is political and social upheaval in this world, likely fueled by the environmental changes and the struggle for resources. Overall, it seems like the world you've created is one that is rich in conflict and complexity, with a variety of different factions and power dynamics at play.


I have multiple Protagonist. 4 at least for now. 3 of them are family members separated due to certain circumstances at different point of the stories. 2 of them stand on the opposite sides and come into a conflict head-to-head at one point. The third one joins the Brotherhood and for the most is busy with the Brotherhood and pirate/raider conflict. The fourth person belongs to the ruling family and maybe in line for the throne or maybe not. But is certainly included in the national politics and warfare. I'm thinking of adding another POV of a scholar or archaeologist but scared to do so. As it will become hard to include all of it. I know the story cannot be told in one book. Maybe a trilogy or four book series?










I am a sentinel of the sea,
Guarding against what's yet to be.
With my brothers, I'll face the tide,
And against all odds, we'll stand with pride.

Sacrifice is our solemn vow,
For the greater god, we'll give our all.
War is not our wish to seek,
But I always ready to see it meet.

My life may be short, but it will be true,
For I'll have served in a brotherhood that sees it through.
With every breath, I'll keep the sea's peace,
With our lives we'll keep the tempests cease.
