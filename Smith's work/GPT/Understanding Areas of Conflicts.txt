Create a villain with a motive and a goal that can be empathized.  Make him utilitarian. Make him someone who is doing the right thing but in the wrong way. Make it that his actions and methods threaten many countries in a 18th century world. The world has just came out of a war like state. Two nations - Hebe and Ruly were at war. Hebe just gained it's independence but at the cost of losing some of it's land to it's colonizers Ruly. It's been a decade since then and a new terrorist organization is wreaking havoc in both Ruly and Hebe along with several other nations in the main land. The villain is somehow linked to this organization but not its leader or controller. 



The world in the story is a fantasy setting, with multiple kingdoms and territories on the mainland and on other lands and islands. The main conflict centers around the relationships between five factions: the four kingdoms on the mainland, the Brotherhood, and a group of anarchic terrorists. In addition, there are two other groups present in the world, pirates and raiders and creatures from the sea that come through portals. The rising sea levels have also caused issues for some coastal communities, including a group of displaced islanders who are seeking a new land to settle on.

The Brotherhood is a religious organization that trains and conscripts young men as warriors to defend the realm from threats both within and outside its borders. They have a reputation for being stubborn, and sometimes prioritize their own interests over those of the realm, but they are widely respected for their martial prowess and are rarely opposed by the ruling families.

The relationships between these factions and characters are the primary focus of the story, and themes include family dynamics, the limitations of one's place in the world, and the choices and actions that determine a person's legacy. The main characters are members of one separated family and a member of the ruling family, who are each involved in different aspects of the world and its conflicts.

There is also invaders - Taliens, who in the past attacked the world by creating a plague that spread like wildfire. They also invaded through a portal from their realm to this one since the plague couldn't affact them. But some from them helped humans of this world by melting the ice caps and opening aother portal to a water world which pulled the water her into this one and submerged the portal underwater which forced the invaders to close it and therefore ending the war. They also created trees which the Brotherhood uses to enhance them and also created a new species of humans by experimentation of race called grey skins who were immune to the plague thus slowing its rate. But humans didn't like their experiments. So another war waged and the Taliens went extinct in this world and the grey skins were driven to the parts where the plague was strongest. Since the humans can't go in that area the grey skins made it their home.

Ages after ages with no new host. The palgue eventually died. As the world cooled down due to high ocean level and the ice caps formed back again some of the virus got trapped in it. But the Ocean level were never the same as before and the Brotherhood was created to stand vigilance if it did. To stop them. Eventually millenias after everyone forgot about all of it. Even the brotherhood did. Now their duty is to stop the pirates and raiders from ruling th ocean and coastel cities and ports. and the nations squabble and war amongst each other.
