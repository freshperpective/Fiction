Karna met with bhisma after abhimanyu's death.
For hus grieve of killing him. 

Bhisma criticised and scolded him for being a cowered and killing a boy from behind the back.
Killing him like a pack of dogs kill their prey by surrounding them. 
He is not a lion like everyone says. 

Afterall how can a doe birth a lion. He is a dog. A cowered dog. 

Karna tried to justify his point. Saying that he only saved the boys life. They were practically torturing him on the battlefield . 

If not for stabbing him the boy would not have gotten a death deserving of a great warrior like him. 

Bhisma said that from today onward he will be known as a man who killed a helpless child. 

Karna in his anger spelt hot lava like words. Cursing bhisma for words. Reminding him that a man who abandoned amba shouldn't talk about righteousness. 

A man who killed a helpless woman shouldn't talk about bravery. 

Bhisma enquired about what he was talking about. 

Karna told him about the story shakuni told him. About how the soldiers of bhisma raped and killed shakuni's mother. 

Bhisma sympathises with karna's foolishness. He tells him about how he has blindly believed his everyword. How all this time he has been led on a stray path by the people he so believes and trust.

Bhisma tells his story.... 

Shakuni's mother committed suicide on hearing about the capture and loss of hee husbands and son. Before we can even reach the palace she was dead. 

It was a hot news and spread loke a wildfire in the city. 


Realising shakunis deception karna leaves immediately to meet him. Without even greeting bhisma.
