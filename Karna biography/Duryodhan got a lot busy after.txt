Duryodhan got a lot busy after that. Naturally whenever he asked(which was most of the time ) I had to go and spend my time at hastinapur being the advisor' nd, shit. He wanted to eliminate all of the pandavs, now that he knew where they were and how they were living.

But since doing that would attract attention and also might reveal the real identities of those brahmins, he decided not to do so.

There was also the fact that they now had a powerful ally in the name of panchal to rely upon. Pandavas were in a really good position fir him to attack on, so he just hid the fact that we even saw. 

Pandavs too tried to remain hidden. They didn't revealed themselves after the swaymvar, the uneasy feeling me, duryodhan and mama were going through cannot be explained in simple words. 'What were pandavs thinking and why haven't they came back already?' was the only thing going in our minds. 

Duryodhan didn't wait to find out, though . He always was the one to race with them, to be the first in everything. This time was also true. He wanted to seize the throne as soon as possible and also to ensure that his line was the one that had the most right to the throne.

He wanted to give the kingdom the eldest grandprince, so that when the time comes, his son will be not have to face the same fate his father did.

So, when the invite of the next swayamvar came he left for it wihtout even thinking twice. No matter the kingdom, no matter how the girl looked or no matter who the king was. He just wanted a queen. 

That's why this time no one except me accompanied him. No even his brothers. 

But this swayamvar also proved to be a little tricky.
