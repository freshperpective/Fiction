Fine I will grant your wish.
But tell them, tell them that they will rule in place of this kingdom. They will be wardens of those five villages. They will swore their allegiance to this kingdom and its king.

They will follow the laws set by the king and will pay an yearly tax and supply goods here on a regular basis.

If they can agree to that, then I can agree to your proposal.

Krishna - No, that is not acceptable. You have already taken their lives. You have already taken their kingdom. You have already burned their palace. They have just got their freedom and now you want to take that back too.

This is not acceptable, duryodhan.

Duryodhan - watch your tongue cowherd. I am the king of bharat. You are just a low level king. How dare you raise your voice in front of me. You low grade scum.

Krishna - Crowned prince, I'll only tell you once. Hold them. Hold your legs. Don't take another step in the wrong direction or you will pay the biggest price.
