Krishna;.....

"I thought that you will have something to say after that" Karna said

"there's nothing I can say that will make you feel better"

"what could justify that?" Karna said choking.

"My.... My...... 
I had already sold my body and weapons to Hastinapur. Only by my soul and will, i was holding my shattered self and it was all gone.... in a second. 

You already knew, 

You kept your smile, you kept it all. 

If only... If only just..... " 
There was no room for any word to say. Karna's only hand went down. It was his determination, the one he held his whole life that was keeping him going. 

Krishna was neither smiling or sad. It was the first time today that his face had turned grimm. Like he was afraid of what was to come. 

Something that was more pointy, more shattering than this piercing truth. 




"there are still many things that you don't know Karna" he said
"but I have to admit, your story your story is the biggest kept secret in this whole war" 

He kept his head down. "but this was the only way left. 

I am sorry it had to end like this." he turned his head to Karna. "But I'll do it again if I have to." 

"that emotion doesn't look good on you... Like you're scared. It reminds me of the expressions my parents had."
