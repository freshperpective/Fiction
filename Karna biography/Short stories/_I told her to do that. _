"I told her to do that. "
"you...ðŸ˜® .... why? "
"well, not forcefully of course. "
"in the swayamvar her first gaze went out to you. She looked at you as if she already knew you. Her attention was all soaked by you. 

I just diverted it a little towards the bhramin standing in the corner.. 
. 
The rest was totally her decision.  "

The remaining coagulated blood inside Karna boiled turned lava as he heard those words . His face twisted. Tremendous amount of heat was going up from his body. 
With all of hus remaining might he lifted his only hand but he couldn't even get it up to shoulders height . The strength in him was almost drained. Instead he punched the side of the chariot  he was leaning on . The whole thing shook, like it had been hit by a bull. His eyes narrowed as he bit the lips. He wasn't looking at keshav anymore. How could he after what he has just heard. Karna couldn't tell him what he felt. He feared that after hearing his honest thoughts keshav would take away his help that he desperately, sourly needed. 

"you can cry you know. 
You can shout, yell, curse. Whatever you want. 
I will hear it all. 
I told you I want to hear your heart. Your honest thoughts." 

"You want to hear me. 
You want to know what I have to say? 
Then listen....listen, you son of a bitch. 
You are the worst of the worst scumbag, a bastard that I have ever met in my life. And I have met Shakuni. 

You are the reason for her suffering. If only you had let her choose as she wanted. If only she had married as her heart desired. She would have been happy. 

She wouldn't have had to live in a hut. 
Wouldn't have had to divide her love into shares. 
Wouldn't have had to change rooms every year. 
Wouldn't have had to spend 13 years in forest. 

I wouldn't have insulted her. In fact she wouldn't have to face that situation at all. 

You are the reason for her suffering,

 for my suffering.
For all the deaths. 

All this time, the anger, the hatred. I thought,....... I thought that it was because of her. Because she rejected me and chose him. 

But it was all you, you bastard. You are coward, the reason I nearly went insane. You are the reason she was disrobed. 

You call yourself an avatar of the god. You say you know what's going to happen. 

WEll DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT? DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU FORCED HER TO MARRY HIM. 

This war. All the dishonourable deaths.
My friends loss. All the rules broken. Just to win a stupid war. 

You wanted this war, just as much as the next scumbag did. 


What was it that you hoped to accomplish, huh?  You say that you did it to prevent further deaths, well you created the biggest massacre in the history. 

//this war will serve as the sign in the upcoming dark age. The kalyug. That age will be like this war. //

All because of you. None will know, no one will even care. But I know, these brave warriors lying on the ground know, you are the true villain in this whole arc.

Yet you potray yourself as the purest of them all. "

Huh.... 

" How easily you said I was the truest villain. 
 But have you even considered to think what I did to prevent this war. 

I didn't wanted this war, my friend

I did come as a peace messenger you know. 
I only asked for 5 villages. Not kingdoms, not capitals, not cities but 5 normal villages. 

And what did you do. You chased me away. Tried to harm me. I knew that this war was inevitable, I just wanted more time. To delay the war as much as possible. "

"If this war was inevitable then why delay it at all. What would that have prevented? "

He smiles. 

"Deaths!! 

To make sure there were less deaths then needed. 

To make sure that great warriors, people with righteousness mind fought for the dharma. 

To make sure I had enough time to make them come to right side. 

To make sure there were no rules to begin with that can be broken. 

I told you I tried to save as many as I could, but in the end this soil still turned red. Mountains of corpses, so much blood, this soil will remain this way for eons. " 

Karna saw hari whisking the sand away from his hands. 

" What about Panchali? How do you intend on justify her? "

" I won't, it's true that I made her saw the brahmin when every time her gaze went to you. It's true I wanted her to choose Arjuna instead. 

But.... It was entirely up to her.
 
I left the entire fate of Bharatvarsh on the soft lips of an innocent girl. 

Her words or the lack thereof will decide where the future will be. 

It was upto her, choose her desire or her destiny. 

She made her decision. 

Remember the mountain, river and ocean "

" so your saying I am the mountain. "

" No, I am saying that Draupadi is the river.

She chooses whether to be still  like a lake in a mountain or ever so flowing like a river towards the ocean. 

And she spoke that day, brilliantly, but the mountain didn't took it well. "

" I was always with her Karna. Because I knew that after her decision she would need me at every turn. I knew what was going to come to her, but I waited. Waited for a brave to stand up in that court. A great warrior, I waited........... for you.

 I knew that if no one would, you would. Because you feel for her. Because you want to protect her. But I was shocked when you insulted her instead. That's when I knew that everyone sitting in that court have sealed there fates. 

Draupadi needed me now, so I went to her. She was alone. 

She is the only person in this epic that isn't on the battlefield but still is the most catastrophic weapon. 

"



So maybe that look that day really was regret. After All she she was looking at me.
.
Then why change the decision? Why choose him than me?

" madhusudhan, if she really wanted me then why reject me. Why accept Arjuna? "

" Don't get it wrong Karna. 
She loves Arjuna, in fact she loves him the most. 
Somewhere deep in the corners is a spot occupied by........ Him. "

"Arjuna loves Subhdra, he hasn't been able to return Panchali's love so to fill that hole. In fact, none of them have fully. So to fill that hole she looks to you. 

She fills her head with you, your approval, your appreciation. 

It isn't love, it's lust. At least for her. "

"but why doesn't Arjuna love her. Who can't love her? "

"Will you be able to love your wife when you know that she has more husbands. 

She has to spend her nights away from you. 
The day you won her, your brother took her away from you. 
And you will only get to even touch her one year in every 5."

If the question was love then for Karna the answer was simple. 

"Yes! "

He widened hus eyes looking towards Karna. Blinking his eyes as he analyzed Karna's swift response. He didn't expected him to answer so quickly but for Karna it was like a reflex. His eyes didn't even twitch as he looked to keshav. Like he was waiting fie this question . Cause For Karna it was a daily scenario. Watching Panchali from afar knowing full well that he can't reach her no matter what. But still day by day, the itching grew. His heart always beats like the footsteps of a horse in her presence. He knew he wanted her. But why? And how?
It was as if, his heart always spinned around on seeing her face.

The day abhimanyu died, he went to the usual spot along the river bank, on the lonely tree. But there was already someone there.
In her saree, she almost matched the color of the river. Only her skin can be distinguished.
But Karna, had seen her so many times or rather had engraved her in his mind, that by just glancing he could tell her from a large crowd.

As he slowly crawled closer, a wisping sound came. The woman, was crying. She was probably remembering her memories with her stepson. Her unshackled raven hair shimmered in the pearl light.

For Karna she was light the sight of a coolness among the burning pearl light if the night. He knew that today he was unwelcomed by river. So, he just went back as he came although very hesistantly, but not before whispering his hearts desire in the air. 

"I'm... I didn't even apologised."
"To whom?" 
"To the woman beneath the tree?" 

"After all this time I still can't figure out why I desire her? Why I find a peace in her face?
 I never had the desire to relax, until I saw her. She was like a calm wind, like a still ocean for my hurling boat. " he smirked
"Yet only now I know that maybe she felt the same. If only....." he sighs. 
"A peace!? "
