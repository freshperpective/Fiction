Sootputra Unsung hero


I wanted to kill my brother my whole life.
Every moment I saw his face I just wished death upon him.
I desired my own sister in law.
I wanted her love.
How can I live with myself now.
And yet still the longing, the yearning for her love hasn't diminished a single bit.
Infact it's more prominent than ever now seeing how easily I can have her.
Just one decision, just one step and I would be with her.
