Karna armor shines whether it is night or day
But his kundals dim as the sun dues over the horizon.
His eyes are black brown but they sometimes burn orange when he is in rage or verry happy

He always wore a long red tika which changed to sun like arched one after he heard about his true parentage.

His eyes die bit by bit as the story progresses though his aura radiates with the same or even more intensity as the story progresses

He rarely wears any jewellery on him as he barely need to with his golden armour and kundal always shining whenever he invokes them. 

The sorrow and pain in his eyes are pointed by several people after the swayamvar. As though he is missing something that he lost a long time ago. 


He has never broken a vow in his life.
