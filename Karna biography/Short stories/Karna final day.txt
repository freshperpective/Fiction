Karna final day

This was the fight i have been waiting for my whole life.
So why is my hand loosening it's grip on the bow.
The bow with which I can win any battle, my heart is telling me to throw it away.

Arjuna then comes in the scene and a storm of conflicting emotions hammer down on this small, now alienated heart.

I don't know if I am radhey duryodhans friend or kaunteya a pandav, arjuna big brother.

The avenger of my brothers death or the one who killed his own nephews. //The one who insulted his own sister in law or the one who avenged his own humiliation. //

The face upon which till now I only wished death, the face that stole everything thing from me was now meant everything to me.

Still among all the others brothers of mine it was against arjuna that my grip on my bow was the tightest. Something in me still wanted to clash with him. Upon seeing his face Something in me still wanted to uphold the vow I made to duryodhan.

The greatest rival, the supposed greatest archer was in front of me. Right now. My bow my strength. Don't know how to greet him.

Before my will falters I attained his attention the only way a archer can. 

The arrow had knocked his head gear down. The warning arrow had indeed forced him to look towards me. His rath(chariot ) was already facing me now. But mine was a little slanted. 
"Looks like the time has finally here. 
The entire heavens watching. don't disappoint them."
Our audience is the entire universe, 
Let's put on some good show. 
Today the world will know who is the greatest archer of all time. "
