"you remember the day when you first told me that I was going to have a sibling"

"yess, I remember yiu cheered and ran straight to vrushali and then to the entire village to tell it. I was so embarrassed to walk outside that day."

"hmmm... Yeah. I really nagged about a baby sister. I wanted to have a sister. Just like you."

"And, you got angry when shon was born"

"yeah, I was upset..... That i didn't got a brother.

God dammit" I shouted.

"Even then I was angry at him. At the start and at the end both times I couldn't accept him. I yelled at him. Even beat him.

Shon was the only person in the world who knew me more then myself. But I couldn't be the same brother to him. I let him down. He doesn't deserve a god forsaken man like me.

I am the biggest disappointment he had,...you had. I betrayed our promise.

I wasn't able to protect him maa. It was because of me that he died. I wasn't strong enough. I got over in my head. I am not a son to you...... "

A slap.
A slap was all I could remember. It came from no where. Then I looked at maa. She tears filled eyes. But a crunched mouth. Bitting her lips in anger like she wanted to hit me more.

I wouldn't have resisted if she had. This was nothing
