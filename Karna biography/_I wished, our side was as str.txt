"I wished, our side was as strong as your will. "

"What do you mean? Shakuni Mama. "

"If for once we agree to your resolution and decide to create a battlefield. What do you think will happen?"

"Don't play with your words, old man.
Speak clearly."

"Then I'll say this in as plain as words allow.

You will become the reason for my nephew's defeat.
He will lose because you stand with him."

"What?
 Are you saying that I am unable to defeat those imbeciles. 

I am weaker than them?" 

"Maybe or Maybe not? 

That's not the point. 
Although it is true that We haven't seen you in a real battle ? 
If it turns out that you're nothing but a pussy in the end. Then what will--" 

"ENOUGH........ 
I would have cut your tongue off if you weren't Duryodhans relative.

But anymore words and 

I will give you the proof of my power, right here, right now." 

"Karna, what's the matter? This isn't you. 
Why are you so angry?" 

"Angry? Why wouldn't I be angry? He is calling me, a warrior a coward when he himself is ready to act like wimp do.

He has no right. " 

"Karna, calm down. 
This isn't about acting like a coward or brave, it's something more isn't it. 

You are gritting your teeth. What is it that bothers you. Tell me." 

As usual he figured me out before I could tell him. 

"Those men that you are so eager to kill hiding behind a veil of fire. 

They are warriors friend. They deserve death on battlefield not burned alive in a Palace. 

You yourself are a great mace wielder, you must understand. 

When the sparks from two maces striking each other blinds your eyes. 

When the the blood of one mixes with the other. 

That's a deserving death. That's what we live for. 

That's what they strive for. 

That's what they deserve. 

This Lakshgraha will snatch us the right of keeping our heads held high. "
