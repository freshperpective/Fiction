Karnaâ€™s origins


Rishi durvasa made the vow imbued mantra in such a way that none of us not even the great trinity can act selfish and take a child born from you. 
Therefore I beg you please don't abandon him,
Don't leave my son on the mercy of this holy river.
I'll do anything....


Surya deva I am forced to make this decision.
.
.
.
Don't tell him about me...
Don't tell him about his real mother.....
He deserves better but I can't accept him as is I am now. 
And if he returns.....
I don't know what I'll do
Maybe I'll accept him but maybe just maybe I'll reject him again.... 
.
