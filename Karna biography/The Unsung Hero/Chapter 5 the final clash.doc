Another clash happened today. My everyday practice of skills and mantras has turned into a gruesome and brutal beating I receive from the Acharya at the end of day whenever we  fight. Every night I greet the bed with my noodle legs, endless bruises and pain in my body. Sometimes I don't even remember how I got into the bed. I have been so close many time but Acharya had counter my every attack at the last possible moment.  Sometimes it feels he enjoys letting me get close just to see my frustataed face in deafeat right after. Though I can sense he is taking every fight seriously now. Every swing, every punch is stronger than before. He is not holding back and I won't give him a chance to. He often praises me for pushing him back and cornering him but that offers no solace. It in turn infuriates and motivates my fists to subdue him in the next brawl no matter what. I have tried each and everything thing, yet to no avail.}

We both started with our bare fists without any weapons in hand. Our hands clutches. Fists hardened like steels in all these years of training. Punches meet each other in the middle. Backing away, dodging, and attacking all in a second. None us can even blink or we will lose sight of our opponent, and that will be bad! Very Bad! I move between his punches. Sometimes under, sometimes jumping over his kicks. But he doesn't dodges any of mine. He just grabs my arm and throws me away. Everything is so blurry, I can't focus on anything except on him or I will lose this time too. Our movement increases with every move we made. We were fighting at speeds wehere we felt the sensation of other's fists first before hearing it's sound rumble in the air. }

Finally we both stopped, as if by mutual understanding Acharya, backed away. We both were trying to catch our breaths. He picked two swords from the stand and threw one at my feet. The blade was polished by me yesterday. it felt familiar, It was my friend. I readied my stance. Even though the intent of kill was missing from the battle, but even a single mistake could cause any one of us our lives. Acharya moves from neutral stance to offensive, He attacks me with resonance. His single strike becomes three, surround my neck from three side. I barely managed to block in the nick of time. I knew being always on the defense won't work on him. I have to up my game, I too took an offensive stance and jumped on him from his sides. Acharya ducked to avoid my attack, but then I used my kick to make him lose his balance. But instead of blocking or grabbing like any normal sane person would do, he kicks it back. I roll down backwards before stopping with my bleeding knees on the ground. }

Then it struck me!! How can I be such a fool!? In all these years of my training and our clashes, he has beaten me so many time. Of course he knows my moves, He knows how I think. He is in my mind. He knows I'm predictable, and all the while he hasn't used any of his own moves instead opting for unorthodox ones to make himself unpredictable.

The difference was noticeable. The Acharya was on his back foot. Even though I couldn't land a solid hit, the satisfaction of him being on the defensive gave me more than needed motivation. But his blocks are too strong and reach in all direction. I imbued my sword with thunder and used all my force to strike from forward. The old man saw it coming. He diverted all of his focus and defense towards the attack. The plan worked, the chance was perfect. Another sword strike came from the back and stopped just before his adam's apple. Acharya started smiling. He dropped his sword and conceded defeat.}

We both picked a dual-sided axe in our hands. I have beaten Acharya in Archery a little while ago, came close with the sword so many times but never with the axe. This weapon was the reason I am brutally beaten and bruised every day when I go to sleep. Acharya wields the axe like an another arm. He twirls even the heaviest ones like a speck of twig. I was holding the axe with my two hands while he was just standing there. His right hand was holding the axe's weight while the left one was telling me to start whenever I want. He was full of openings, his stance didn't covered a whole lot yet I was afraid of attacking him. He radiated a terrifying aura whenever he wielded his favorite friend. He would wipe me out even on a single misstep. Yet I ran towards him holding my axe in one hand, I knew that the axe can't be blocked by any other weapon except for a shield. But he was already gone. A tearing gaze was looking at my back. I barely managed to jump back and dodge his attack. He was barely even pushing himself. The only way to take him down was resonance. Being on defensive won't do me any good. I swung my axe at him. My every stroke became multiple, but he was too good. He is a tough opponent, but I was still ahead. Acharya to counter this advantage came with his offence He closed the gap between us in an instant. Before I could even realize it I was spouting blood from my mouth as he plunged the handle of his axe right in my gut throwing me back like a doll. }

Blood was still dripping from my mouth when I grabbed my bearings. While he was still standing on his feet ready for more. I was barely holding my balance. This will be the last straw. Taking a huge risk, I threw the axe at him. He was a little shocked. Thinking it was my last burst before eventually extinguishing, he extended his free hand towards the upcoming axe as though wanting to grab it in mid-air. Finally! Finally! I was the predicting his actions now. I was the one in his head. The single upcoming axe turned into multiple. Acharya panicked for a second. Forgetting his previous thought, he was holding his axe with two hands now. This was my chance, I rushed towards him. He deflected the axes that were directly aimed for him while letting the rest pass him by. }

Sure I threw an axe at him but I never let go of mine. It was there in my hand the entire time. I aimed for the Acharya with my axe. He tried to dodge by sidestepping but the axes he had just let go were blocking his way. He was cornered. For the first time, Acharya tried to block my attack but axes are not meant for blocking. My attack managed to slashed through the wooden handle of the axe stopping just before his heart. }

The Night was warm that day. With the air not blowing over the cold feelings. I swinged a wooden fan over his head. Suddenly, a bee entered the hut. It was buzzing around all over and scaring it off wasn't working. This was not good if it continued to buzz like that the Achrya's sleep would've been broken. I tried to scurry it away without hurting it but it just came to rest on my other lap. I didn't dare squash it. That would've definitely disturbed his sleep. Therefore I let it rest where it was and the small bug turned out to be a silent traitor when a small jolt ran thorugh my thigh. The bee had just stung me on my lap and fallen there. It had left it's stinger which soon attracted more of it's friend trying to avenge their fallen comrade. Their number kept increasing. Before I knew there were ten to twelve on and around my right leg. Blood was dripping from it. The pain was immense but I had to endure. I had to make sure the Acharya slept well. I didn't even realized when I dozed off in that pain.}
