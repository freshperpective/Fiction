Chapter 4: The Training}

The training extended long in nights and began at early freezing dawn with runs around the Ashram and the slopes of mountain with only my genitals protected by the fluttering cloth. After that Acharya would teach me about the world and its history about the gods and kingdoms. Then in the afternoon after the breakfast, I would be plunged into the Ashrams training ground to practice without any weapon. Some times to test me, Acharya himself will become my opponent and beat me senseless till I faint. Although I could feel that by each passing day I was getting a little stronger, a little faster, My senses were getting sharper but it was still not enough to catch up to him. In the evening Acharya would ask me questions about the last week's teaching and I would answer them with my full capability. Then comes the night, Acharya would take me to a secluded cave or sometimes a solitary tip of the mountain and would teach me new skills and techniques to further increase my progress. Then after the session It was my duty to clean and organize the Ashram's wares, repair and maintain its condition while guru prepared the supper. For the first year Every day would be the same routine over and over again.}

Acharya had warned me to never do any excess practice than allowed. But I knew that to be recognized and acknowledge by the society I have to work harder than anyone else. Every now and then, in night while Acharya would be in a deep sleep I would steal a few hours and practice or meditate in night to further enhance my state of mind and physical being and before the first ray of dawn could hit the Ashram I would sneak back into sleep.}

After the first year passed Acharya finally started my weapon training, though I wasn't allowed to touch any other weapon except for the one I was training with. }

During the practice in Archery, Acharya would correct my balance, the way I stand, the way I control my breathing. I became better at most mundane of tasks. My hands became stronger, steadier, yet at the same time delicate while aiming. The archery was easy enough even with the heavier of bows, Acharya even praised me on occasions for my intense focus which he said rivaled his own. I was sure he was just falsely praising me so that I could work harder next time. The Archery training took the smallest of time, as Acharya one day stopped me and said he was finished with everything that was there to teach about basics of that weapon.}

Then came the axe, Acharya first taught me how to handle an axe before any classical sword or spear. I wondered why but then I understood as I practiced. The axe was heavier and not easy to move. Due to it's wooden handle and stem it was low on defense and could easily be cut by a sharp sword. Therefore I had to constantly dodge every blow that he sent at me while at the same time attacking him so as to avoid defending all the time. Of course it doesn't help that Acharya is the master of this weapon. He rotated even the heaviest of axes on his fingertips. It was as though the axe was just another arm of his. It followed every command and flowed with his rhythm. I knew I was getting better and better at the art but, In the end I couldn't beat him.}

After that it was turn for swords, spear and mace. They came in every shape and sizes. The small daggers, the long swords, the short spears and the heavy maces. Each one of them have their own quirk and peculiarities as if they were individuals not weapons. As usual Acharya allowed me to switch to another only when I had mastered the previous one. }

By now my whole body was covered with deep scars with every shape, size and depth. But somehow, I was inertly happy, I was getting to train under such an immortal Legend whose name was already written down in eternity. I always thought what price Acharya had to pay to become this strong. He has collected a lot more scars like mine throughout his life. He would've avenged so many defeats and would've experienced many more battles. The thought made my heart jump through the roof. I wanted to be like him, I wanted to surpass him. I will suffer through any harm if I had to, just to touch this dream.}

This was unusual for him as he had never let me skip on chores before infact if I tried he would just increase my laps or extend my meditation. I hated meditaion. We both sat down in the hut, Our position on the mat was always the same. I faced the rising sun and Acharya faced the setting one.}

Once my basics were done I was taught mantras to invoke elements of the world and also make my weapons infinitely more potent. After only a month, I was able to summon wind, make water pour out of the ground, expand the fires emitting from a torch or pyre, Summon thunder and storm, break apart the boulders itself. I trained and trained until I became close to perfect at honing this craft. Worshipping the gods before invoking their power and thanking them for their blessings after using it. Even Achraya Parshurama himself seems to enjoy this part of the training. I saw him smile more and more, getting casual around me while also being the strict teacher he was. It was clear from his sparkling eyes and smirky face that he was as excited about my progress as I was and also by the fact that he continued to extend my meditating hours every week.}

The river flowed down to the valley and gave me a narrow look down on the world where the cold shades of darkness were dwindling from every nook and cranny and were being erased by a light that was bright, strong and warm. For that split moment I could see everything. Every tree that dared to stand and grow against this cold barren harshness, the people and their domestics who've survived through with their strong will and persistant, Every wild animal that cleverly adapted itself to live and the darkness itself which always thrived no matter how strong the light.

The next couple of months were very gruesome. The skill was very hard to even understand, let alone practice. The world was sometimes real and other times bending, melting before my eyes.

My arrows were now starting to connect with the target again and with my newly developed skills their number increased tenfold. I was feeling more connected to my body, soul and mind. The world arround me seemed to be talking to me. My mantras and spell from before became hundred times more potent. The fire is intense enough to melt the rocks. The Thunderstorm and rain is enough to flood an entire kingdom. I could hit ten targets at once, fight ten at once, lift ten times the weight. It was like my body was overflowing.

The vast gulf of difference between our strength is apparent. When I arrived at the Ashram he merely played with me. But now he was fearsome in battle. He changes his form instantly. Defending one second than attacking the next. It takes immense focus just to keep Acharya in sight. One mistake and I would never catch the next thrashing. I always get brutally beaten in the end, though I can sense that I am getting closer. Just a few more days and the clash will come when I will give him a new scar.}
