As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting its final rays across the polluted landscape, a haunting stillness settled over Anta and his faithful steed, Devdutt. The once vibrant hues of the surrounding foliage had faded to a sickly gray, mirroring the desolation that had befallen the land. Their journey along the cursed banks of the Ganga had led them to this desecrated realm, where the remnants of a forgotten civilization lay entwined with the river's mournful whispers.

Anta's heart ached with each passing moment, the weight of the polluted air pressing down on his chest. He glanced up at the sky, where only a few feeble stars twinkled through the thick shroud of darkness. The solar storm that had ravaged the world's satellites had left this corner of the country in perpetual gloom, severed from the rest of civilization. The absence of electric light was a constant reminder of the struggle that lay ahead—a battle to reclaim the lost radiance of the land and, perhaps, even the forgotten purity of the Ganga.

Ram, his mentor and guide, rode steadfastly ahead, his weathered face a map of determination. His eyes, gleaming with an inner fire, revealed a deep understanding of the world's mysteries—a knowledge that Anta yearned to possess. He urged Devdutt forward, matching Ram's steady pace, determined to learn the lessons hidden within the darkness.

As they continued their arduous trek, the stench of decay and chemicals intensified, a putrid cloud that permeated the very essence of their beings. Anta tightened the grip on his reins, willing Devdutt to keep moving forward despite the overwhelming repulsion that threatened to consume him. The mare snorted and flicked her ears, sensing her master's unease, and together they pressed on, their shared resilience a testament to their unbreakable bond.

The path they traveled was treacherous, strewn with debris and remnants of a forgotten era. Crumbling buildings stood as skeletal sentinels, their broken windows gazing hollowly into the abyss. The river itself, once a source of life and vitality, had become a murky channel of despair. Toxic foam clung to its surface, mingling with the ripples of filth, as if the river wept for the lost innocence it could never regain.

Anta's heart sank, his young spirit burdened with the weight of this desolation. He couldn't fathom how such a blighted river could ever be saved. Yet, the flame of hope flickered within him, fed by Ram's unwavering purpose. There had to be a way, a flicker of light amidst the darkness, and he clung to that glimmer with every fiber of his being.

They rode on, the sounds of their horses' hooves echoing through the desolate landscape. The air crackled with an otherworldly stillness, broken only by the distant hoot of an owl or the rustle of an unseen creature in the undergrowth. Anta's senses heightened, attuned to the subtle whispers of the land, as if it held secrets waiting to be unveiled.

In the days to come, Anta knew that their path would be fraught with danger and uncertainty. But he was ready to face the challenges, to dive into the depths of the unknown, for he had chosen this path willingly. With each stride, he drew closer to Gokund—the sacred birthplace of the Ganga—where ancient magic and forgotten wisdom awaited their arrival.

Anta tightened his grip on the reins, determination etched upon his face, and whispered a prayer to the heavens.



As the sun sank below the horizon, casting a crimson glow over the desolate landscape, Ram suggested they make camp before darkness fully engulfed them. Anta scanned the area, searching for a spot along the riverbank that held the least amount of filth, a small sanctuary amidst the wretchedness. Devdutt, however, had other plans. The mare came to a sudden halt, refusing to budge despite Anta's coaxing and tugs on the reins. Intuition surged within him, recognizing the unspoken warnings that only animals could sense.

Dev's unwavering determination sparked a flicker of concern within Anta's heart. In the past, her instincts had saved them from danger, such as the time she had sensed an impending earthquake before anyone else in the vicinity. She had guided Anta to safety, but not everyone had been as fortunate. Trusting his faithful companion, Anta informed Ram of Dev's unease. Ram, with a knowing nod, instructed Anta to stay back while he ventured beyond the bend in the river, disappearing from Anta's view. Anta's apprehension was momentarily eased by the sight of Ram's axes materializing in his hands. Although they unnerved him at times, he knew their presence signaled a formidable protector in times of need.

Suddenly, a voice cut through the stagnant air, Ram's urgent call beckoning Anta to rush forward. The young boy abandoned Dev, his guns drawn, adrenaline coursing through his veins. As he rounded the bend, expecting to face an enemy, his heart sank at the sight that greeted him—a lifeless body sprawled upon the shore, with Ram crouched beside it. The man's mangled form hinted at a violent demise, his missing foot suggesting a harrowing encounter with the river's treacherous currents. The scent of decay mingled with the polluted river, overpowering the senses and solidifying the tragedy that had befallen the unknown soul.

With a heavy heart, Ram concluded that the man had likely perished elsewhere and been mercilessly swept along the current, ultimately meeting his final resting place on this desolate beach. Anta's curiosity gnawed at him, prompting him to inquire whether the deceased was a resident or a fellow traveler. Ram, his gaze scanning their surroundings, confessed his uncertainty. The answers, he surmised, might be found in Rishikesh, the closest city. Anta couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, that unseen eyes observed their every move. Shadows danced in the depths of the silent forest, whispering secrets that refused to be deciphered.

Together, Anta and Ram dug a grave for the fallen stranger, a solemn ceremony for a life extinguished. Anta questioned why they didn't cremate the man, to which Ram offered a cryptic response—their presence had attracted the attention of something or someone, and a grand pyre would serve as a signal to both friend and foe. Anta couldn't comprehend the depths of Ram's knowledge or the mysteries that enshrouded him, but he knew his mentor's words held weight. He understood that Ram had become a guardian of their village, protecting them from Maleables with his fearsome axe, the only weapon capable of combating their malevolence. Ram had gifted their people with knowledge and protection, and now he spoke of his own mortality, a concept Anta struggled to accept.

A few clicks away from the grave, they set up camp, the crackling fire casting dancing shadows upon their faces. Anta busied himself with gathering wood, feeding the flames that fought against the encroaching darkness. Ram, the provider of sustenance, prepared their meal, his preference for vegetarian fare a reminder of the death and decay that surrounded them. Anta found solace in the notion of temporarily abstaining from meat, a symbolic act of solidarity with the desolated river and the silent forest that yearned for rejuvenation.

As the fire roared, casting its warm glow upon their weary forms, Anta couldn't shake the foreboding sense that their journey held greater significance than he could fathom. 




In the heart of the night, Anta's peaceful slumber was abruptly shattered, his senses awakening to an inexplicable disturbance. The dying fire in front of him struggled to retain its warmth, urging him to rise from his blanket-clad haven. As he approached the dwindling flames, he realized that Ram was nowhere to be seen. A pang of concern gripped Anta's chest, driving him to search for his mentor amidst the veil of darkness.

Moving silently, Anta ventured toward the nearby riverbanks, his steps guided by a mixture of trepidation and curiosity. Soon, he caught sight of Ram perched upon a solitary rock, his gaze fixated upon the polluted waters below. Intrigued and eager for answers, Anta quietly approached, his footsteps muffled by the symphony of the night.

Anta noticed Ram engrossed in deep conversation, his voice carrying an air of solemnity. "I don't have much time," a woman's voice whispered, barely audible yet laden with urgency. "Perhaps a fortnight at most."

Ram's response, though faint, reached Anta's ears. "We will be there well before that," he assured her, his eyes remaining fixed upon the polluted river's surface.

Anta's brows furrowed with confusion and intrigue. Was it truly the river speaking? His mind raced with questions, desperate to understand the depths of this mysterious encounter.

As if sensing Anta's presence, the woman's voice grew softer, as if shrouded in caution. "Is the boy ready?" she asked, her words laced with uncertainty.

Anta strained his ears to hear Ram's reply. "No," he confessed, his voice tinged with regret. "We need more time."

A surge of bewilderment washed over Anta's young mind. What were they not ready for? And who was this woman who conversed with the river itself?

"Were you ready when it was thrust upon you?" the woman's voice questioned, laden with a haunting wisdom.

"No one ever is," Ram admitted, his gaze finally breaking away from the river as he turned his attention inward.

Curiosity burned within Anta's veins, yet he knew better than to intrude upon the private discourse unfolding before him. Sensing the weight of the situation, he silently retreated to the safety of their camp, his mind awash with questions and a lingering sense of foreboding. What secrets did the river hold? And who was this enigmatic woman who spoke from its depths? Anta settled back into his blankets, knowing that the journey to save the dying Ganga held far greater mysteries than he could fathom.




The following day, Anta couldn't help but steal glances at his teacher, hoping for even the slightest hint of concern or acknowledgment regarding the events of the previous night. However, Ram's gaze remained fixed on the darkened sky above, casually remarking about the possibility of impending snowfall. Today's journey would take them through a desolate town and its crumbling bridge, remnants of a once-thriving civilization. Anta tended to Dev, feeding her and gently patting her mane, finding solace in the connection he shared with his loyal mare. Ram observed this act and mirrored it, tending to his own stallion.

Anta's mind raced, contemplating how their world had descended into such ruin. The thought lingered, casting shadows of doubt upon his heart. Ram inquired about Anta's practice for the day, a peculiar question considering Anta always trained during the night or when they made camp during daylight hours. Ram abruptly halted his stallion, prompting Anta to dismount. Anticipation gripped Anta as he watched blue fireflies manifest around Ram's hands, swirling and morphing into luminous strings that buzzed with an otherworldly energy. Soon, the threads transformed, solidifying into two gleaming axes, held firmly in Ram's grasp. Anta's heart pounded within his chest, a mixture of fear and anticipation coursing through his veins. He longed to step away, to escape the pain that those axes inflicted upon him. But he knew the consequences would be severe, so he remained, his gaze fixated on the cruel blades and the agony they represented.

"Hold it," Ram commanded, his voice firm.

"You know I can't," Anta replied, his voice laden with reluctance and a hint of defiance.

"You have to," Ram insisted, unwavering in his demand.

Why? Just because a dead river said so! Anta wanted to retort, to voice his doubts and frustrations, but he swallowed his words. Resigned, he reached out, gripping the heavy axe with both hands. As Ram released his hold, the tip of the axe struck the gravel road below, the weight almost unbearable for Anta.

"Concentrate!" Ram urged, his voice laced with determination.

"I am," Anta replied, though doubt tinged his voice.

In that moment, a spark flickered, a tiny surge of energy that sparked between Anta and the axe. A sudden jolt of electricity coursed through his body as the axe vanished, leaving behind scorch marks upon his palm.

"I told you I can't," Anta lamented, his voice filled with frustration and pain.

"And I told you, you have to," Ram countered, his tone unyielding.

"I'm not you. I can't be," Anta muttered, the weight of his inadequacy bearing down upon him.

"Good! Because you have to be better," Ram declared, manifesting the axe once more. "Again!" he commanded.

The grueling training continued for what felt like an eternity, stretching on for half an hour. With each attempt, Anta's palms blistered and boiled, the pain a constant reminder of his limitations. He had bandaged his hands with the herbs provided by Ram, their restorative properties working their magic. Anta could already feel the tingling sensation of healing coursing through his veins, a bittersweet reminder that he would have to endure the same painful experiment once more tomorrow. Why did he have to become Ram's student? Anta pondered, his thoughts drifting to the days following the devastating attack on Shambala, the village he once called home. Ram had saved him, the lone survivor of that harrowing ordeal. The maleables had breached the protective dome that shielded Shambala, leaving destruction and death in their wake. Anta's family—his sisters, grandparents, and his mother who had perished protecting him—had all been mercilessly taken away. The subsequent days, filled with grief and loss, had brought Anta and Ram together. Ram became his guardian, training him in various disciplines, imparting knowledge of combat, weaponry, herbs, meditation, and more. Anta became more than a student; he became part of Ram's makeshift family—the closest thing to kin he had left.

And now, that family was keeping something from him. Something Anta wasn't ready for. The weight of uncertainty and unspoken secrets weighed heavily upon him, intertwining with his own sense of guilt and failure. The whispers of doubt echoed in his mind as he whispered to himself, "Sorry, Ganga," his words barely audible, a silent plea for forgiveness. The realization gnawed at his core, for he knew that whatever lay hidden within the depths of Ram's intentions, it demanded more of him than he could bear.


As the sun began its descent, casting a golden hue upon the horizon, Anta and Ram neared the outskirts of Rishikesh. A flurry of white descended from the sky, resembling delicate cotton balls floating in the air. Anta's initial assumption of snow quickly dissolved as the particles sizzled upon contact with their skin. "Ash," Ram corrected, his voice filled with urgency. Their eyes widened simultaneously, a silent understanding passing between them as they urged their horses into a swift gallop, hastening towards the source of the chaos.

The distant sounds of screams and cries reached their ears, mingling with the crackling of flames devouring the town. The air thickened with tension and desperation. Drawing closer, their senses heightened, and the shadows birthed a sudden assailant, lunging at Ram with ferocious intent. Ram's instincts kicked in, his quick reflexes and mastery of summoning allowing him to deflect the attack with precision. Anta swiftly drew his guns, ensuring the enchantments on the barrels were still intact. He loaded the magazine, his hands trembling with a mix of fear and adrenaline, and aimed at the creature engaged in battle with Ram.

But as he gazed upon the figure, his heart sank. It was a maleable—the very beings that had razed their home to the ground. Its form shifted and contorted, a grotesque four-legged beast devoid of eyes, its back adorned with slimy, tentacle-like appendages. Ram gracefully evaded one of its assaults, the creature relentlessly closing in. He called out to Anta, urging him to provide cover. Fear clutched Anta's heart, his hands quivering uncontrollably, memories of his mother's last words resounding in his mind, instructing him to stay hidden. The echoes of the past reverberated within him, threatening to consume his courage.

"ANTA!" Ram's voice shattered the grip of the haunting memories, pulling Anta back into the present nightmare. The urgency in Ram's tone pierced through his wavering resolve, compelling him to action. Why were they here? Anta questioned, his voice strained with anxiety, as he pulled the trigger. Bullets erupted from the barrels, leaving behind ethereal trails of misty blue. Some found their mark, striking the beast, but it persisted, undeterred by their assault.

Ram seized a moment of opportunity, finding a gap in the creature's defenses. With a swift motion, his axe plunged deep into its monstrous form, delivering a fatal blow that echoed with finality. The maleable writhed momentarily before collapsing, defeated by Ram's skill and unwavering determination.

Ram's stern gaze met Anta's remorseful eyes, an unspoken understanding passing between them. Anta knew he had failed, and he knew the scolding would come later. Ram managed to calm his horse, a silent gesture of readiness, and together they rode towards the flickering glow of the burning town, the screams and pleas for help growing louder with each passing moment.

As they approached Rishikesh, Anta's eyes widened at the sight of maleables scaling the walls. Bipedal creatures, similar to the ones he had encountered in Shambala, controlled the dead and transformed them into these abominations. The realization struck him like a blow—these bipedals were once human, trapped within their twisted forms. Fear gripped Anta, causing his body to tremble uncontrollably, his gaze darting from one horror to another.

Ram, perceiving Anta's distress, issued a command to halt at the gates. "We stick to the path," he declared firmly, his voice resolute despite the chaos that unfolded before them.

Anta's voice trembled as he pleaded, "But what about Rishikesh? People are still fighting! They need help. We have to save them. We can save them."

Ram's response was unyielding. "No, we can't."

"It isn't right. We can't let them die, not like Shambala," Anta persisted, his voice filled with determination.

"And I can't let you die. You're the only thing that matters," Ram's voice held a weight akin to stone. "I can't protect you and save them both."

"I can fight," Anta protested, his words laced with desperation.

"No, you can't." Ram reached out, grasping Anta's trembling hands. He had noticed the fear that consumed him. "We're going. We will do what we came here to do."

Anta's resolve wavered, but a flicker of defiance remained. He engaged in a battle of words, desperately trying to change Ram's decision. Yet, when his teacher refused to budge, Anta's determination flared. He spurred Dev forward, urging his horse towards Rishikesh, leaving Ram behind.

"ANTA!" Ram's voice called out, carried by the wind, but Anta didn't look back. Uncertainty clouded his thoughts. Was Ram following him or had he abandoned him for the sake of a river? Questions gnawed at his mind, but amidst the turmoil, Anta knew he couldn't face all the maleables alone. However, if he could even save a few souls from the horrifying fate that awaited them, his life would hold meaning. It would be a testament to his mother's love and pride.

Amidst the raging fire and billowing smoke, Anta plunged into the chaos of Rishikesh. Soot-covered children cried, their innocent faces stained with tears. Men, maimed and broken, crawled and screamed in agony. Some continued to fight, their gunfire resonating through the air, though most had already met their grim fate. Determination etched across his face, Anta dismounted from Dev, giving her a firm slap on the hindquarters, urging her to flee. And she did, galloping away from the scene.

Drawing his guns, Anta steadied his trembling hands, the fear giving way to adrenaline coursing through his veins. His heart pounded in his chest, threatening to burst with every beat. He closed in on the weeping children, firing at the approaching maleables with a newfound resolve. His shots found their mark, felling the twisted creatures one by one. The echoes of gunfire attracted the attention of other maleables, diverting them from their prey toward Anta.

"Oh, shit," Anta muttered under his breath, the relentless barrage of bullets continuing. However, he knew the enchantment on his guns would soon wear off. Time was running out. "Move!" he shouted at the children and the remaining adults, urging them to escape. Some obeyed, fleeing from the impending danger, but others remained frozen, their expressions a mixture of bewilderment and disbelief.

"GO!" Anta yelled once more, and this time they listened, finally heeding his desperate plea. The maleables, distracted by the fleeing townspeople, diverted their attention away from Anta. He tried to recapture their focus by shooting at them, but only a few paid him any notice. Now, with half a dozen bipedals and a dozen four-legged monstrosities closing in on him, the majority still pursued their defenseless prey.

In the midst of this dire situation, something sliced through the air, severing the head of one of the bipedals. The swinging axe embedded itself in a nearby wall, as black, gooey blood pooled on the ground. "Idiot! Move!" Ram's voice echoed, breaking through the chaos. He swung his other axe, severing a limb from another maleable, momentarily halting its advance.

The weight of helplessness bore down on Anta, reminiscent of his days in Shambala, when he was but a vulnerable child. The sight of the relentless maleables claiming more lives was a torment to his soul, a relentless reminder of his own powerlessness. Ram, valiant as he was, could not single-handedly stem the tide of death. Anta felt his heart shatter with each passing life lost, his every fiber yearning to intervene, to make a difference.

And then, amidst the turmoil, a cry pierced through the chaos, drawing Anta's attention. Ram's voice cut through the maelstrom, commanding Anta's focus. "Anta, catch!" the words rang out, carrying a sense of urgency and purpose. Anta's eyes widened as an axe soared through the air, embedding itself in the unforgiving pavement near him. It was an invitation, an opportunity for salvation. Without hesitation, Anta reached out, his trembling hands grasping the handle of the axe, hoping that it would grant him the power to vanquish the maleables and protect those he held dear.

But the axe, ever obstinate, refused to yield to his touch. It resisted his efforts, defying his desperate attempt to wield it. Anta strained with all his might, his hands trembling under the strain as he struggled to lift the burden of the weapon. His resolve flickered, a fragile flame threatened by a gust of wind. Yet, before he could even take a step forward, the axe abruptly dissipated, vanishing into the ethereal realm from whence it came. The air around Anta grew heavy with disappointment and frustration, mirroring the weight upon his heart.


All hope seemed extinguished, vanquished by the same cruel fate that had befallen Shambala. Anta's spirit withered as he beheld the desolation before him, knowing that like the doomed village, this town too would succumb to its demise. There would be no survivors this time, no threads of life clinging to existence. Overwhelmed by the weight of despair, Anta sank to his knees, surrendering to the darkness that threatened to consume him.

The tumultuous symphony of screams, cries, and his teacher's imploring voice faded into a distant echo, as if swallowed by the void that enveloped him. A frigid chill seeped into his bones, as if he were descending into the cold embrace of death itself, while still drawing breath. His eyes bore witness to the macabre tableau unfolding around him—the walls adorned with streaks of blood, severed limbs strewn like grotesque offerings, and lifeless children strewn upon the cold, unforgiving ground.

And then, something shattered within Anta, as if fragile glass melting in a searing fire. A seething heat surged from the depths of his being, coursing through his veins like a raging inferno. In the midst of his anguish, Anta screamed, unleashing a torrent of raw power. For a fleeting moment, the world erupted into blinding brightness, an incandescent flare that seared the senses.

Ram's voice pierced the chaos, a desperate plea to regain control. But within Anta, something darker, more vengeful, surged forth. It yearned for the annihilation of the maleables, for their very essence to be consumed by the all-consuming flames. Hatred and fear mingled, intertwining like serpents coiling in his core, until they found release. Fire erupted from him, engulfing the maleables in a dance of agonizing torment. They writhed, consumed by the searing pain that mirrored Anta's inner turmoil.

Anta screamed until his voice grew hoarse, until it seemed an eternity had passed. Exhaustion finally claimed him, pulling him into the depths of unconsciousness. As his weary body gave way, the flames waned, leaving only smoldering embers in their wake.

Hours stretched like an eternity as Anta's weary consciousness stirred, reclaiming him from the depths of oblivion. His eyelids fluttered open, and what he beheld was a haunting sight that would forever be etched in the recesses of his mind. The town, once teeming with life, lay before him in ruins, a barren wasteland of charred remnants and desolation.

The very ground upon which he stood bore the scars of destruction, now transformed into a bleak expanse of ash and cinders. Not a single tree remained, their once vibrant branches reduced to skeletal remnants, reaching out futilely for a vanished sky. The maleables, those grotesque abominations that had brought ruin upon this place, had vanished like specters into the abyss.

Yet, amidst the overwhelming devastation, a different horror awaited Anta. The acrid stench of burning flesh and seared meat permeated the air, a nauseating reminder of the merciless inferno that had consumed the town. He cast his gaze upon the lifeless bodies, their forms charred beyond recognition, their features obscured by a veneer of blackened coal.

As his eyes scanned the somber tableau, searching for signs of life amid the macabre aftermath, they found solace in the figure of his teacher. Ram, wounded yet resilient, dedicated himself to tending to his injuries amidst the sea of carnage. The sight of his mentor, a beacon of steadfastness in the midst of chaos, provided a flicker of solace amidst the overwhelming darkness that surrounded them.

Anta's eyes lingered on Ram's injured form, his mind awash with memories of past encounters where his mentor had endured untold hardships. The immortal man, seemingly impervious to the ravages of time, had always exuded an air of invincibility. Yet, there were rare instances when the facade cracked, revealing the vulnerability that lay beneath. The last time such a sight had met Anta's eyes was during the cataclysm that had consumed Shambala, where Ram had suffered grievous burns. The memory of charred flesh, peeling skin, and the weeks of agonizing recovery that followed still haunted him.

Ram, however, had never uttered a word of complaint. He bore his pain in silence, his unwavering dedication to protect Anta serving as a testament to his indomitable spirit. Time and again, he had placed himself in harm's way, sacrificing his own well-being to shield Anta from the horrors of their world. And what had Anta offered in return? More opportunities for Ram to risk his life, more chances for disappointment to seep into their bond. In the depths of his self-doubt, Anta questioned his worthiness as Ram's student. Did he deserve the guidance and protection bestowed upon him? Did he possess the courage to voice his doubts or the strength to walk away?

Caught in the labyrinth of his own thoughts, Anta's internal musings were interrupted by Ram's voice, breaking through the haze of introspection. The immortal man, his gaze fixed upon Anta, inquired about the fate of the town's survivors, a flicker of concern evident in his eyes. It was a reminder that, even in the face of adversity, Ram's unwavering focus remained on those he sought to safeguard. Anta's troubled heart found a fleeting respite in the presence of his mentor, a respite that bore the weight of unspoken gratitude.

Anta's determination propelled him through the desolate aftermath of the destroyed town, his every step a painful reminder of the devastation he had unleashed. The once vibrant streets now lay in ruins, their charred remnants mirroring the state of his conscience. Scorched bodies, crumbling structures, smoldering remnants of wagons and cars, and a pervading veil of smoke and ash — this was the handiwork of his destructive power. The Maleables, in their twisted existence, at least left behind transformed victims or claimed lives one by one. Anta, in his unleashed fury, had obliterated an entire town in an instant, eradicating everything within it. The weight of this realization pressed upon him, tightening its grip with every labored breath.

Driven by a desperate desire to salvage what remained of his shattered intentions, Anta scoured the ruins with frantic determination, searching for any signs of life amidst the silence. With each passing moment, panic intermingled with the ashes and embers that surrounded him. His heart, burdened by guilt, slowed its rhythm as he trudged forward. And then, beneath the layers of debris and the fading embers, he heard it — faint voices emanating from the depths of a temple's basement.

Summoning every ounce of strength he possessed, Anta cleared the rubble obstructing the entrance, allowing the imprisoned voices to break free. A dozen souls emerged, their faces etched with both relief and disbelief. Among them were the fortunate few who had sought refuge in the river, narrowly escaping the town's incineration. Some carried injuries, but nothing that would render them immobile. In total, there were two dozen survivors, including several children, clinging tenaciously to life amidst the ruins.

Anta led the survivors to Ram, their silent savior who had tended to his own wounds while waiting for their return. As Ram's eyes met Anta's tear-filled gaze, he understood the significance of their arrival. Unstoppable tears streamed down Anta's face, their flow mirroring the rivers of anguish within him. Overwhelmed with a mixture of relief and sorrow, he dropped to his knees before his revered teacher, his sobs punctuating the gravity of the moment.

"Not... everyone... died," Anta managed to utter through choked sobs. The weight of his words settled upon the broken ground, an admission that, amidst the vast tragedy, there was still a glimmer of hope.


After collecting himself, Anta turned towards the small gathering, his gaze fixated on the ground beneath his feet. The weight of guilt bore down upon his shoulders, threatening to shatter his fragile composure. His trembling voice, laced with remorse, tremored through the air, reaching the ears of the survivors who stood before him, their eyes brimming with a mix of trepidation and resentment. The atmosphere crackled with tension, each breath thickened by a palpable sense of anger and uncertainty.

The townspeople regarded Anta with cautious apprehension, their expressions hardened with a distrust born from the ashes of their destroyed homes. The smoldering embers of their once peaceful existence painted a stark backdrop against which Anta's plea for forgiveness unfolded. His words, a fragile plea born of a wounded soul, sought solace amidst the sea of accusing glares. Yet, he could not bring himself to meet their eyes, fearing the condemnation he would find within them.

A young woman, her face etched with grief and righteous anger, stepped forward to voice the collective anguish that pulsed through the crowd. Her voice, quivering with a mixture of fear and resentment, pierced the heavy silence. "How can we trust you? Look at what you've done!" Her accusatory words hung in the air, punctuating the profound sense of betrayal shared by her fellow survivors.

Ram, observing the volatile tide of emotions crashing upon the shores of their fragile sanctuary, stepped forward. His presence commanded attention, a bastion of calm amidst the tempest of anger and sorrow. With measured words, he sought to bridge the divide, to offer understanding where there was only bitterness. His voice, steady and resonant, carried the weight of experience and compassion.

"Consider the alternative," Ram began, his tone a mix of firmness and empathy. "Imagine your loved ones transformed into Maleables, stripped of their humanity, driven by an insatiable hunger for destruction. They would no longer be the fathers, mothers, or siblings you cherished. Their very essence would be consumed by an insidious darkness."

The young woman, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, interjected, her voice tinged with defiance. "But they would still be alive! At least we would have had a chance to save them."

Ram held her gaze, his eyes filled with a profound understanding. "Yes, they might have continued to draw breath, but their souls would have been lost. A fate worse than death, trapped within a twisted existence devoid of their true selves. Anta, in his own flawed way, spared you all from that unimaginable horror. And those who perished... he granted them release from an end that even the gods would shudder to witness. He may not deserve your gratitude, but he certainly does not warrant your unbridled hatred."

The silence that followed hung heavy in the air, each passing second carrying the weight of unspoken emotions. Ram's voice cut through the stillness, firm and resolute. "It's time to go," he declared, his gaze unwavering as he locked eyes with Anta.

Reluctantly, Anta turned to the remaining villagers, his voice tinged with a mixture of hope and resignation as he made one final plea. The old woman, the girl, and two men hesitantly nodded, their expressions a blend of weariness and curiosity. They were willing to take a chance, to step into the unknown alongside Anta and Ram. But the majority, their faces etched with pain and distrust, remained steadfast in their decision to stay behind.

Anta's heart sank as he acknowledged the reality before him. Their words of rejection echoed in his mind, a painful reminder of the devastation he had inadvertently wrought upon their homes and lives. He knew he couldn't blame them for their refusal, for their lingering resentment. The resemblance between this desolated town and the ruins of Shambala, left behind in their escape, struck him like a cruel mirror of his past failures.

In that moment, a flicker of realization ignited within Anta's mind. A long-lost thought, buried beneath layers of guilt and self-doubt, clawed its way to the surface. Could it be? The presence of gods, their unseen hand guiding his path, or perhaps their judgment shaping the fate of those around him. The notion both terrified and intrigued him, leaving him with an insatiable curiosity that begged to be answered.

Yet, Anta restrained himself, pressing his lips together in a silent resolve. He would bide his time, waiting for the cover of night when he and Ram would find themselves alone. It was then, under the cloak of darkness, that he would dare to voice his burning questions, to seek the truth that gnawed at the edges of his consciousness.

Memories of Shambala flooded his thoughts, each fragment like shards of glass reflecting the pain and loss he had endured. The haunting image of the village, blackened and smoldering, lingered in his mind. He remembered waking up, disoriented and grief-stricken, atop Dev's back as Ram skillfully guided them away from the decimated remnants of their former lives. The village grew smaller in his vision, shrinking with each passing moment until darkness claimed him once more.

The next time he awoke, it was in a place far removed from the ruins of Shambala. Ram stood by his side, unwavering and resolute, as Dev stood nearby. It was then, in that tender moment, that Ram entrusted Anta with the care of Dev, an unspoken symbol of trust and acceptance. It marked the beginning of their intertwined journey, as Ram took Anta under his wing, the final student in a lineage of shared pain and relentless perseverance.


As they embarked on their arduous journey towards Gangotri, the birthplace of the sacred Ganga, Anta found himself assuming the role of caretaker for his newfound companions. Each step he took was accompanied by a sense of responsibility, as if they were bound by the ties of blood rather than circumstance. Devdutt, the trusted steed, carried both the old woman and the young girl, while the two men walked alongside Ram, forming the vanguard of their group.

Ram, ever resourceful, had fashioned spears from the nearby woods, distributing one to each member. They became the shield that would guard against unseen dangers, while Anta focused on his own task of revitalizing his enchanted guns. With meticulous care, he concentrated the solution, his steady hands wielding a tiny brush to inscribe the intricate mantras onto the surface. The symbols etched into the metal, holding the power of ancient incantations, seemed to shimmer with an ethereal glow.

Amma, as Anta respectfully called the old woman, observed his actions with curiosity. Her voice quivered with intrigue as she questioned his knowledge. "You know mantras too?" she asked, a touch of awe evident in her wrinkled face.

"A little, Amma," Anta replied, walking alongside Dev, his eyes focused on the road ahead. The young girl, entrusted with the reins, navigated the horse with a touch of uncertainty, earning the occasional playful tug from Dev's spirited nature. Anta couldn't help but chuckle softly, recognizing the quirks of the faithful steed. After all, even the most noble of horses had their idiosyncrasies.

"He taught me," Anta continued, gesturing towards Ram leading the way. The chestnut stallion, burdened with their supplies, bore the weight with grace and strength.

Amma's curiosity persisted, and she probed further. "What else did he teach you?"

"What he could," Anta replied, a sense of gratitude resonating in his voice. "Physics, math, science, astras, shastras, mantras, and history."

Amma's eyes widened in surprise, her interest piqued. "No myths? No gods or epics? No demons or rakshas?" she inquired, sharing a glimpse of her own wisdom. "Ichcha here knows much about them. I personally taught her."

Anta glanced at Amma, then turned his gaze towards Ram, contemplating her words. " 'There are no myths, just lies and misunderstood stories,' Sir says," he responded, a hint of conviction in his tone. As he finished inscribing the final mantra on one of his guns, he cradled it in his palm, witnessing the glow of the symbols and the subtle mist that emanated from its tip. Relief washed over him, a soothing balm for his previous helplessness. He vowed never to experience such vulnerability again, hoping that circumstances would never demand it. Yet, an inexplicable intuition gnawed at his gut, whispering of an inevitable next time. Thus, he felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that his weapon was now ready, should that time arise. He holstered the gun, shifting his attention to the other, continuing his meticulous work.

Amma's voice sliced through his thoughts, her words hanging in the air, reverberating with a tinge of mystery. "Funny you say that when you are traveling with a myth himself," she remarked, her pace adjusting to keep up with Devdutt's steady stride.

Anta's ears perked up, his gaze fixing on the woman, his steps faltering and then quickening to match her pace. "When was the last time anyone saw Parshu-Ram, the rarest among the seven immortals?" she questioned, her words casting a veil of intrigue upon their journey.

"Parshuram!? He is Parshuram?" Ichcha exclaimed, her voice brimming with elation.

"Yes, girl. And you, boy? What is your name?" Amma inquired, her eyes gleaming with curiosity.

"Anta," he replied. "I'm called Anta."

"Peculiar name," Amma remarked. "Do you know what it means?"

"End. End of all things!" Anta declared with a touch of solemnity.

Amma's eyebrows arched inquisitively. "And why would a mother name her son 'The End of all things!'"

"She didn't. He did," Anta explained, pointing towards Ram. "Every parent in our village took their infants to him to name. He was the guardian, the guide, the priest, and the teacher. My teacher!"

Amma's gaze shifted towards Ram, contemplating the significance of his role. "And you didn't ask him?" she pressed, her voice laced with gentle curiosity.

Anta found himself at a loss for words, realizing that he had never questioned the origin or meaning of his name before.

Throughout the past seven years, only Ram had addressed him as Anta. There had been no one else, for all the children he once knew resided in Shambala, along with everyone he cared for. Every encounter with other individuals or groups had been fleeting, not substantial enough to ignite any doubts about his identity or the status quo. It was only now, in the presence of Amma's questioning, that he found himself pondering his name, his existence, and ultimately, himself.

"Do you know who he is?" Amma inquired, her tone tinged with intrigue.

"I know he is immortal. He doesn't age, he never loses a battle, not even to illness. He is the invincible one," Anta replied, his words tinged with reverence.

"Yet today, I see his back burned and bruised," Amma noted. "He is not the only immortal on this earth, Anta."

"There are others?" Anta's voice held a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

"Seven, to be exact! Including your teacher here," Amma revealed, her gaze shifting towards Ram. "In our temple, there was a book filled with tales of old, tales of Avatars and the people who aided them. So many stories, myths, and legends. Among them were the Seven Immortal Sages, blessed with eternal life to guide, guard, and protect the realm. However, as time changed and ages turned, people forgot about them. Some of the immortals themselves even forgot their purpose. Freed from the constraints of time, they became disillusioned. Some sought extreme thrills to experience the fear of death, while others clung to existence, barely holding on due to their immortality. It is said that nothing can harm them, for their very essence is entwined with this world and the passage of time. Yet today, I have witnessed an immortal in pain. The pain of an immortal, an enigma in itself."

The river beside them flowed with a newfound clarity, the once muddy waters gradually transforming into a translucent current. Its increased flow mirrored the dropping temperature, a tangible sign of their journey's progression. Anta reached into the saddlebags, retrieving a blanket that had weathered many adventures. Carefully, he draped it over Amma, her frail form cocooned in its comforting embrace. The gesture spoke volumes about his genuine concern for his newfound companions, treating them with the tenderness of kin.

Curiosity danced in Anta's eyes as he turned to Amma, his voice laced with genuine interest. "Do you know her?" he inquired, pointing towards Ichcha, who sat beside Amma, her face radiant with the warmth of the blanket.

Amma's aged fingers pointed to the man walking beside Ram, her voice holding a hint of pride. "He is her father, my son," she revealed, the subtle inflection in her voice suggesting a tale of love and sacrifice. Anta's gaze shifted towards Ram, the unspoken connection between them suddenly more profound.

"They followed you?" Anta sought confirmation, his voice a quiet whisper amidst the rhythmic sounds of nature that surrounded them.

"Yes," Amma nodded, her eyes conveying a depth of emotion. "Blood may not bind us all, but our hearts intertwine like the roots of a tree. Family, in its truest essence."

Anta's gaze wandered to Ichcha, her delicate figure framed against the backdrop of their campsite. His curiosity tugged at his thoughts, and he couldn't help but inquire further. "And her mother?" he asked, his voice laced with a gentle concern that mirrored the weight of his own guilt.

Amma's gaze softened, her weathered features etched with sorrow. "Gone," she replied, her voice carrying the weight of loss. "Taken from us two years past."

Anta's heart sank, burdened by the remorse that lingered within him. He struggled to find the right words, a silent ache tugging at his soul. The flickering flames of the campfire illuminated his contemplative silence, casting an introspective glow upon his face.

As the night settled in, their weary bodies sought solace near the river's edge, drawn to its soothing presence. Anta watched the flickering firelight dance upon the water's surface, casting shimmering reflections that mirrored his own ruminations. The soft gurgles of the flowing river intermingled with the crackling of the fire, a harmonious symphony of nature's melodies.

In the quietude of the evening, Ram's figure caught Anta's attention as he made his way towards the river's embrace. Intrigued, Anta's feet instinctively followed, an unspoken curiosity propelling him forward. He found refuge behind the shelter of a sturdy tree, blending seamlessly with the shadows as an avid spectator to Ram's enigmatic rendezvous.

Anticipation welled within Anta's chest as he watched the muddy waters of the river come alive, swirling and shaping themselves into the delicate form of a young girl. Her stature barely reached Ram's knees, her ethereal figure a manifestation of water and magic. Transfixed, Anta marveled at the seamless transformation, his eyes drinking in every ephemeral detail.

A childlike voice, woven with innocence and mischief, emanated from the water-born girl. It danced upon the gentle evening breeze, a whimsical serenade that enchanted the night. The river's essence breathed life into her words, as if they were but ripples on its surface, carried forth to the ears of those who dared to listen.

Ram's countenance grew stern, his expectations demanding more than the childlike façade before him. He urged her to embrace her true form, to shed the innocence and speak with clarity. Anta sensed an unspoken familiarity between them, a bond that transcended the realms of ordinary companionship.

Ganga, for that was the water spirit's name, obliged, her transformation revealing the elegance of a serene woman. Her voice, now mature and serene, resonated with a wisdom that belied her youthful appearance. It spoke of timeless secrets and hidden depths, a voice steeped in the wisdom of ages.

The air crackled with unspoken tension, a palpable weight hanging in the space between Ram and Ganga. Their words danced upon the night, their voices embodying the duality of friendship and conflict. Anta, hidden amongst the foliage, observed the interplay of emotions, his own curiosity surging like an unrelenting tide.

Ganga's voice took on a touch of reproach, a tinge of resentment tingling in her words. "There is no time left, Ram. He must know," she insisted, her tone carrying a sense of urgency.

Ram's weathered face bore the weight of countless years, etched with the burden of his immortal existence. He hesitated, the lines of his brow deepening as he wrestled with the weight of his own choices. "He is but a boy," he countered, his voice tinged with a hint of weariness.

"The timing was your decision, not mine," Ganga retorted, her voice laced with a touch of frustration. "You chose to train him, to entrust him with those axes. The moment has come, whether you are ready or not."

A hint of sorrow softened Ram's gaze as he met Ganga's eyes. "You cannot comprehend the losses I have endured over the eons," he murmured, the weight of his words carrying the echoes of ancient grief. "Immortality is not the gift it appears to be."

Ganga's voice softened, her anger dissipating into a bittersweet understanding. "Indeed, we can both agree on that," she replied, her words now tinged with a solemn acceptance of their shared fate.

Anta slipped away before their conversation could reach its conclusion, not wanting Ram to notice his presence. When Ram returned from his contemplation by the river, Anta stood there, the first one to greet him. His gaze fixated on Ram, questioning and piercing.

"What is it that you want?" Ram asked, his voice laced with curiosity as he pulled out some food onto his plate.

"When we fled from Shambala, it was already gone," Anta began. "Infested with Maleables like Rishikesh."

Ram's expression turned sorrowful. "Today must have awakened forgotten memories," he muttered. "I hadn't considered that."

"But I never forgot," Anta declared. "I couldn't. As we escaped, I witnessed Shambala burning just like Rishikesh. But when the Maleables attacked, they didn't set fire to homes or crops. They went after the living, anything with a breath."

"Stop right there!" Ram raised his palm, halting Anta's words. He knew where this conversation was headed.

"Why didn't we ever go back, Sir?" Anta probed further, closing the physical and emotional distance between himself and Ram. "When the Maleables left, when the danger subsided, why didn't we return?"

"There was nothing left to return to," Ram replied, his voice heavy with grief. "Everything was gone."

"But there were still bodies," Anta pressed on. "We know Maleables only turn the living, those who still breathe. So they couldn't have consumed or taken the corpses that lay there. Why didn't we go back to cremate the dead? My family, my mother—they are still lying there, rotting. Or have they already been cremated?"

"Anta, please, stay calm." Ram reached out his hand, attempting to steady the agitated boy.

"Or what? Will I go ballistic again? Like I did in Rishikesh? Like I did in Shambala?" Anta's hair flared up, his eyes turning a fiery gold. The sweat on his brow evaporated into steam as he shouted, his voice filled with anguish.

"Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me that I burned Shambala? That I killed all those people—my friends, my grandfather, my father, my sister, Maa!"

"You are just a boy, Anta. You had no control. Those deaths were not your doing, but the Maleables'," Ram reassured, placing a gentle hand on Anta's shoulder. This time, Anta didn't resist.

"I am not a boy," Anta replied, his voice weighted with a heavy burden. "I am the person who slaughtered two towns' worth of humans. Their deaths weigh on my conscience. I am a murderer."

"Today, you saved around two dozen people. And then you saved yourself. Shambala had already fallen by then. Your mother had already taken her last breath when you first awakened," Ram explained, his touch conveying both comfort and wisdom. "If you can learn to control your powers, you have the potential to become a savior, not a murderer."

"Then teach me," Anta pleaded, looking up with determination.

Ram hesitated, a few seconds passing as if he wanted to say yes but couldn't. "This is something you must do on your own. There will be others who can help you, people more suited for the task than me. But ultimately, it will be up to you to control and harness the power within you."

"I want no one else, only you," Anta insisted.

"Anta, I can't be there for you at all times," Ram said, a tinge of sadness coloring his words.

"You're talking like an old man," Anta retorted. "You're an immortal. Where would you go?"

Ram gazed at Anta and offered a relaxed smile. "Fine. But technically, I am a five-thousand-year-old man."

That night, Anta immersed himself in intense training. Ram instructed him to focus on manifesting the fires at will. Anta made numerous attempts, his determination evident, but all he managed to achieve was a change in his irises from black to gold as his body temperature rose. No fire or heat erupted as it had done before.

Ram then handed him his axes once again, encouraging Anta to lift them. This time, Anta didn't hesitate. The fear that had plagued him earlier had long dissipated. Though his hands trembled as he grasped the handles, he refrained from complaining. The axes remained in his grip for a longer duration than before, but eventually, they dissipated, leaving a familiar jolt coursing through his hands.

"If only you had been this committed earlier," Ram remarked as their training session concluded. Anta anticipated a smile or a proud expression, but instead, he was met with a look of disappointment from his teacher. It seemed as though it was too late, as if he had missed his chance.

Anta pondered whether it truly was too late, if he was truly unprepared as Ganga had suggested. It was time to have a direct conversation with her. Next time, he would go with Ram, whether his teacher liked it or not.

The next morning, their arduous journey resumed. The path ahead grew steeper, challenging both the travelers and their horses. Shakti, Ram's horse, bore the weight of the luggage and the people with visible strain. He panted heavily and let out continuous neighs of exertion. Recognizing his struggle, the three men at the front of the group decided to alleviate some of the burden by distributing it among themselves. The load was redistributed, and the men carried on, but Shakti's panting persisted, though slightly subdued.

Anta's concern shifted to Dev, his faithful mare. Despite not displaying visible signs of distress like Shakti, he could sense her quiet struggle. The weight she carried was taking its toll, and they still had a couple more days of travel before reaching their destination. Anta knew that the air would only grow thinner from this point forward, adding another layer of difficulty to their journey.

The anticipation of the thinning air weighed on their minds as they continued their ascent. The challenges they faced were not merely physical but also a test of endurance, both for themselves and their trusted companions.
